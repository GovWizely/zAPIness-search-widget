### Basic Usage

[Live Demo](https://govwizely.github.io/zAPIness-search-widget)

zAPIness-search-widget will be loaded in any webpage by embedding the following javascripts into the page:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = "https://govwizely.github.io/zAPIness-search-widget/static/js/main.js";
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);

  window.onload = function() {
    // Initiate the search widget with endpoint
    zAPI.SearchWidget.new({
      mountPoint: "#zAPI-sw-root",
      host: "https://rrsoft4.zapiness.xyz",
      endpoint: "sample_api",
      fields: [
        "agency",
        "description",
        "end_date",
        "supplier_name",
        "supplier_country",

### Troubleshooting

__Snapshot Tests fails__

Snapshot Test aims to capture the latest html generated by the component. If the component is changed, it is expected that the snapshot file should be updated as well. To update the snapshot, run ```npm install jest-cli -g``` and ```jest --updateSnapshot```

__Search Widget does not search on the page after embedding the codes__

Ideally, ```mountPoint``` parameter will take care of creating the div element with the given id. If the search widget does not show up, manually insert a div with the desirable id on the page.
